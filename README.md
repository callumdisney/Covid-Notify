# So, who made it?
The api used is the [Corona Rest API](https://corona-rest-api.herokuapp.com/Api/), built on the [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
The base code was written by [traditionallimb](https://github.com/traditionallimb). {Callum Disney](https://github.com/callumdisney) (me) refined parts of the code and added more. That is the code uploaded here.
